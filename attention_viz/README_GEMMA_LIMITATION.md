# Important Note: MedGemma-4b-it Capabilities

## Model Capabilities

- **LLaVA-Rad**: A true vision-language model that can process both images and text
- **MedGemma-4b-it**: Medical-focused model (capabilities to be verified - may be text-only or multimodal)

## Implications for This Project

If MedGemma-4b-it is text-only, the comparison would be limited to:

1. **LLaVA-Rad**: Full multimodal analysis with attention visualization on chest X-rays
2. **MedGemma-4b-it**: Medical responses (with or without image context depending on capabilities)

## Possible Approaches

### Option 1: Text-Only Comparison
Compare how both models respond to medical questions, with LLaVA-Rad having access to the image and Gemma providing text-only reasoning.

### Option 2: Use a Different Multimodal Model
If MedGemma-4b-it is text-only, consider using another medical VLM such as:
- Med-Flamingo
- BiomedCLIP
- Another LLaVA variant

### Option 3: Image Caption + Gemma
1. Use LLaVA-Rad to generate image descriptions
2. Feed these descriptions to MedGemma-4b-it
3. Compare final diagnoses

## Running the Current Implementation

The code will still run, but:
- MedGemma's processing depends on whether it supports image inputs
- Attention visualization for MedGemma may be limited to text-to-text attention if it's text-only
- The comparison may not be meaningful for medical imaging tasks

## Recommended Changes

If you want a true multimodal comparison, consider using:
```python
# If medgemma-4b-it is text-only, use a multimodal model:
model_id = "llava-hf/llava-v1.6-mistral-7b-hf"  # Another LLaVA variant
# or
model_id = "microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224"
```
